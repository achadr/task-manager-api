## Getting Started

### Backend

The backend is a REST API built with Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and SQLite.

See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for detailed backend documentation including:
- API endpoints
- Setup instructions
- Development workflow
- Testing

To run the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

Frontend implementation coming soon.

## Development

Each part of the application (backend/frontend) has its own package.json and can be developed independently.
